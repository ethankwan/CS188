# Introduction-to-Data-Science
Data Science Fundamentals. 3 projects, all done on actual industry data sets (i.e Heart Disease Patients, AirBnB listings in NY, taxi rides in Manhattan). 

# Project 1
Developed Linear Regression model to predict the price of an Airbnb listing in New York based on the features most correlated with the price. 

# Project 2
Developed Binary Classification models to determine whether a patient, given a set of his or her medical assessments (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.), should be diagnosed with heart disease.

# Project 3
Developed a Tree Regression model that trains a different Linear Regression model to predict the duration of a taxi ride depending on the conditions of the taxi ride in question. 
The model is able to generate more nuanced predictions and has an RMSE that is 50% lower than the constant Linear model. 

# Machine Learning
Implemented KNN and Perceptron in Python.
